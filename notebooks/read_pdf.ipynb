      "Many current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\n",
      "ity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good\n",
      "reasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\n",
      "data outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\n",
      "used for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\n",
      "data (trillions of words [3]).\n",
      "However, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\n",
      "relevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\n",
      "dominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In\n",
      "machine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words\n",
      "or less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in\n",
      "any signiﬁcant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\n",
      "With progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more\n",
      "complex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably\n",
      "the most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [10]. For example, neural\n",
      "network based language models signiﬁcantly outperform N-gram models [1, 27, 17].\n",
      "1.1 Goals of the Paper\n",

      "vectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary. As\n",
      "far as we know, none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more\n",

      "50 - 100.\n",
      "We use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representa-\n",
      "tions, with the expectation that not only will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that\n",
      "words can have multiple degrees of similarity [20]. This has been observed earlier in the context\n",
      "of inﬂectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for\n",
      "similar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to ﬁnd words that have similar\n",
      "endings [13, 14].\n",
      "Somewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple\n",
      "syntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are per-\n",
      "formed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vec-\n",
      "tor(”Woman”) results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the word Queen [20].\n",
      "In this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model\n",
      "architectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test\n",
      "set for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities1, and show that many such regularities\n",
      "can be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss how training time and accuracy depends\n",
      "on the dimensionality of the word vectors and on the amount of the training data.\n",
      "1.2 Previous Work\n",
      "Representation of words as continuous vectors has a long history [10, 26, 8]. A very popular model\n",
      "architecture for estimating neural network language model (NNLM) was proposed in [1], where a\n",
      "feedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to\n",
      "learn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been\n",
      "followed by many others.\n",
      "Another interesting architecture of NNLM was presented in [13, 14], where the word vectors are\n",
      "ﬁrst learned using neural network with a single hidden layer. The word vectors are then used to train\n",
      "the NNLM. Thus, the word vectors are learned even without constructing the full NNLM. In this\n",
      "work, we directly extend this architecture, and focus just on the ﬁrst step where the word vectors are\n",
      "learned using a simple model.\n",
      "It was later shown that the word vectors can be used to signiﬁcantly improve and simplify many\n",
      "NLP applications [4, 5, 29]. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different\n",
      "model architectures and trained on various corpora [4, 29, 23, 19, 9], and some of the resulting word\n",
      "vectors were made available for future research and comparison2. However, as far as we know, these\n",
      "architectures were signiﬁcantly more computationally expensive for training than the one proposed\n",
      "in [13], with the exception of certain version of log-bilinear model where diagonal weight matrices\n",
      "are used [23].\n",
      "2 Model Architectures\n",
      "Many different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words,\n",
      "including the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\n",
      "In this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, as it was\n",
      "previously shown that they perform signiﬁcantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities\n",
      "among words [20, 31]; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets.\n",
      "Similar to [18], to compare different model architectures we deﬁne ﬁrst the computational complex-\n",
      "ity of a model as the number of parameters that need to be accessed to fully train the model. Next,\n",
      "we will try to maximize the accuracy, while minimizing the computational complexity.\n",

      "projection layer ( P) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size His typically 500 to 1000\n",
      "units. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the\n",

      "the relationship vector (we average the individual vectors together), we have observed improvement\n",

      "6 Conclusion\n",
      "In this paper we studied the quality of vector representations of words derived by various models on\n",
      "a collection of syntactic and semantic language tasks. We observed that it is possible to train high\n",
      "quality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network\n",
      "models (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, it\n",
      "is possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set.\n",
      "Using the DistBelief distributed framework, it should be possible to train the CBOW and Skip-gram\n",
      "models even on corpora with one trillion words, for basically unlimited size of the vocabulary. That\n",
      "is several orders of magnitude larger than the best previously published results for similar models.\n",
      "An interesting task where the word vectors have recently been shown to signiﬁcantly outperform the\n",
      "previous state of the art is the SemEval-2012 Task 2 [11]. The publicly available RNN vectors were\n",
      "used together with other techniques to achieve over 50% increase in Spearman’s rank correlation\n",
      "over the previous best result [31]. The neural network based word vectors were previously applied\n",
      "to many other NLP tasks, for example sentiment analysis [12] and paraphrase detection [28]. It can\n",
      "be expected that these applications can beneﬁt from the model architectures described in this paper.\n",
      "Our ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension\n",
      "of facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for veriﬁcation of correctness of existing facts. Results\n",
      "from machine translation experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also\n",
      "interesting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [30] and others. We believe that\n",
      "our comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for\n",
      "estimating the word vectors. We also expect that high quality word vectors will become an important\n",
